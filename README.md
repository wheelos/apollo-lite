## Introduction

Apollo-Lite provides powerful modules and features for autonomous driving
development. Before getting started, please ensure your environment meets the
prerequisites and follow the installation instructions below. For a deeper
understanding, refer to the
[architecture overview](http://apollo.auto/docs/architecture_overview.html) to
learn more about the core technologies and platform design.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Machine:** Minimum 8-core CPU, 8GB RAM
- **GPU:** NVIDIA Turing GPU recommended for acceleration
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

---

## Installation

> Detailed installation steps and scripts are provided for a smooth setup.

---

## Quick Start

**Note:** For quick startup and verification, only the CPU-based image
(simulation planning module) is provided. The full GPU-dependent tutorial will
be released later. We recommend starting with the CPU image because the GPU
image is large and has complex dependencies, which may not be suitable for
beginners.

### 1. Install Deployment Tool

```bash
pip install whl-deploy
```

### 2. Setup Host Environment

Run the following scripts to prepare your host machine. These steps will:

1. Install Docker (checks if already installed)
2. [skip] Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit (checks if already installed, depends
   on Docker)
3. [skip] Perform host system configurations

```bash
whl-deploy setup docker
```

### 3. Start Docker Container

Download and start the Apollo container image (only required once):

```bash
bash docker/scripts/dev_start.sh -d testing
```

To enter the running container environment in subsequent sessions:

```bash
bash docker/scripts/dev_into.sh
```

Set environment variables:

```bash
source cyber/setup.bash
```

### 4. Build Apollo

To build the entire Apollo project:

```bash
./apollo.sh build_cpu
```

To build a specific module:

```bash
./apollo.sh build_cpu <module_name>
# Example:
./apollo.sh build_cpu planning
```

**Note:** If the build process is killed due to out-of-memory (OOM), try
reducing the number of build threads:

```bash
./apollo.sh build_cpu dreamview --cpus=2
```
